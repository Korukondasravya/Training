JAVA SCRIPT
DEF: It is a object based and obj oriented programming language used to convert static page into dynamic page 
DATA TYPES:
1)Premittive DT
*Number
*string
*Boolean
*undefined
*null
*bigint
2)Non premitive DT:
*class
*object
*functions 
*array
*map
*sets
SCOPES:
global
local/script
block 
3-TYPES
1)var
2)let
3)const
Operaters:
Its is a pre defined symbol used to perform specific operation
Arithematic: +,-,*,/,%,++,--
Assignment
Logical
Ternary
Relational
Functions
These are first citizen in javascript
In javascript functions are treated as object
Types of Functions
1)Function Declaration statement/Named function/Pure Function
2)Function Expression
3)Fuction Programming(Iear order function, callback Function)
4)Arrow Function
5)Nested function
6)IIFE(Immediate Invoking Function Expression)

1)It is a set of instruction or block of code used to perform specific task
Syntax:
function fun-name(parameters,....)
{
  set-of-instructions
}
full-name(arguments,....)

Advs:
Code reusability
Return Key word-Will stop execution of function
Hoisting-Calling before function declaration 
In function Expression Hoisting is not possible(reference error)
In function Declaration Hoisting is possible
Function Ex:
Assigning function as a value to 1 variable It is used to perform specific task

Differences b/w Function Declaration and function Expression

1)Hoisting: Expression not possible

2)Syntax: Declaration has Function Name, Expression Has Anonymous function

3)both are specific value

Function Programming:
Ier Order fun, call back fun

It is used to perform generic task(Multi task)
A function programming can be created using function declaration statement and function expression and arrow function

Ier:
A function which accepts another function as an argument is called ier order function 
Call Back;
A function which is passed as an argument to Ier order function is called call back function 

IIFE: Immediate invoking function Expression
-> It will be called immediately once the function object is created 
Syntax:
     (expression(function))()
(function()//Anonymoues function
{

})()

(()=>{//Arrow function

})()

(function demo(){//Named function

})()
When we will use the multiple iife function that will be terminated as a ";"

ARRAY IN JAVASCRIPT:
-> Array is used to store the data of an different data types 
->So it is Heterogeneous

Creation of Array:
->By using the new keyword

Objects in JavaScript:

It is used to store the data in the form of key and value pairs
It will use the declaration way

let obj={
name:"Sravya",

}

Asynchronous function- Making a way for other function to execute 
2 inbuilt methods 
setTimeout(call back function,delay-time)  //It will give the output only once
setInterval(call back function,delay-time) // it will execute for every delay time
This is present inside window object

promise:
*It is an object
*it is used to look after asynchronous function
*3 phase
->pending phase(Either promise will be resolve or reject)
->Resolve/fulfilled (When the asynchronous fun is successfully)
   *The promise will accept one method(.then(cbf))
->Reject (When the asynchronous fun is not successfully)
   *The promise will accept one method(.catch(cbf))

Syntax:
  new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
async fun
})
.then(cbf)
.catch(cbf)
DOM(Document Object Model):

screen,history,navigator,navigation,storage,fetch,DOM
                                                   |
                                                 Document
                                                    |
                                                 Html
                                  *Head(title,meta)   *body(all tags)
*Dom is a object
*It is having a root element called document
*it has the life-span until the page is reload
*It is used to create,update,delete the element and we can provide styles using dom.
                                                    
2Types of Medhods:
1)Direct Access Method
2)Indirect Access Method
EVENTS in DOM:
Types:
->Keyboard events:
*key-up
*key-down
*key=-press
->Mouse-event:
*onmouseover
*onmouseleave
*onclick
->pointer-event:
*clickevent
*dblclick
->pointer Event


Manipulation/Modification of DOM: It is updating or modifying the DOM.

Method: createElement()

Steps:
1)create element using createElement() method
2)Append that element to the parent elements using append or appendChild method

Eg:
let a=document.createElement("h1")
console.log(a)//<h1><h1>
a.textContent="Hello"
 document.body.appendChild(h1)



JSON: JavaScript Object Notation


API:It will communicate between two applications

It has 2 types
*SOAP:Simple object acess protocol
http,ajax(XHR)
*REST:Representational state Transfer
http,JSON

JSON:
It is a plain text file where data will be stored in the form of key-value pairs. and all keys will be enclosed with the double quotes.
Steps:
1.create a .json file
2.store the data in form of key and value pairs and key should be enclosed with double quotes.other than undefined and function we can use any data-type to create a json

Methods of JSON:
1) Stringify():It will convert object into json data-type
2)Parse():It will convert json data-type into object
